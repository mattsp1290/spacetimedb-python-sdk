# Task 5: Implement Lazy Import Pattern - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Task 5 has been successfully verified as complete. The lazy import pattern was already implemented in the `connection_builder.py` file's `build_pool()` method to avoid circular import dependencies between `connection_builder.py` and `connection_pool.py`.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Lazy Import in build_pool() Method**

The `build_pool()` method in `connection_builder.py` uses a lazy import pattern:

```python
def build_pool(self) -> 'ConnectionPool':
    """
    Build a connection pool instead of a single client.
    """
    # ... validation code ...
    
    # Lazy import to avoid circular dependency
    from .connection_pool import ConnectionPool
    
    # Create the connection pool
    pool = ConnectionPool(...)
    
    return pool
```

### 2. **Key Features**

- **Local Import**: The `ConnectionPool` class is imported inside the method rather than at module level
- **Clear Documentation**: Comment explains why the lazy import is necessary
- **Type Hints**: Uses string annotation `'ConnectionPool'` for the return type
- **Circular Dependency Avoided**: Prevents the circular import chain between builder and pool

### 3. **No Module-Level Imports**

The `connection_builder.py` file has no direct module-level import of `ConnectionPool`. It only imports it within the TYPE_CHECKING block (for type hints) and within the `build_pool()` method.

### 4. **Shared Types Module**

Both `connection_builder.py` and `connection_pool.py` properly import shared types from `shared_types.py`, avoiding the need for cross-imports.

## Verification Results

All verification tests passed:

```
✅ Lazy import in build_pool - Lazy import properly implemented with comment
✅ No direct pool import - No direct ConnectionPool import at module level
✅ build_pool functionality - build_pool method exists and is callable
✅ No builder import in pool - connection_pool.py doesn't import SpacetimeDBConnectionBuilder
✅ Shared types usage - Both modules properly import from shared_types
```

## Usage Example

The lazy import pattern allows the builder pattern to work seamlessly:

```python
from spacetimedb_sdk import ModernSpacetimeDBClient

# Create a connection pool using the builder
pool = (ModernSpacetimeDBClient.builder()
        .with_uri("ws://localhost:3000")
        .with_module_name("my_module")
        .with_connection_pool(min_connections=5, max_connections=20)
        .with_retry_policy(max_retries=5)
        .build_pool())

# Use the pool for operations
def my_operation(client):
    return client.call_reducer("my_reducer", {"arg": "value"})

result = pool.execute_with_retry(my_operation, "my_operation")
```

## Impact

This implementation ensures:
- **No Circular Imports**: The SDK can be imported without any circular dependency errors
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between builder and pool modules
- **Performance**: No unnecessary imports at module load time
- **Maintainability**: Well-documented pattern that's easy to understand

## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Lazy imports for circular dependency resolution**
2. **Clear documentation of import patterns**
3. **Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type-only imports**
4. **String annotations for forward references**
5. **Shared types module for common data structures**

## Conclusion

Task 5 is complete. The lazy import pattern has been successfully implemented and verified. This pattern, combined with the shared types module and proper use of TYPE_CHECKING, ensures that the circular import issues are fully resolved while maintaining type safety and clean architecture.

All circular import fixes (Tasks 1-5) are now complete, and the SDK is ready for production use without any import issues.
