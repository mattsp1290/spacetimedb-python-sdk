# Task Summary: ts-parity-14 - Specialized Data Structures

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive specialized data structures for the SpacetimeDB Python SDK, providing high-performance collections optimized for SpacetimeDB-specific use cases. This implementation brings the Python SDK to feature parity with TypeScript and other SDKs in terms of specialized data handling capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### Core Data Structures Implemented

#### 1. OperationsMap
A high-performance key-value store with custom equality support and multiple storage strategies:

**Features:**
- Custom equality functions for complex key types
- Multiple storage strategies (dict, ordered dict, custom)
- Thread-safe operations with RLock
- Performance metrics tracking
- Dict-like interface (`__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, `__contains__`, etc.)
- Iteration support with `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`

**Usage:**
```python
# Custom equality for complex objects
def player_equality(p1, p2):
    return p1.id == p2.id

ops_map = OperationsMap(equality_func=player_equality)
ops_map.set(player1, {"score": 1000})
```

#### 2. IdentityCollection
Specialized collection for SpacetimeDB Identity objects:

**Features:**
- Efficient storage using hex string mapping
- Thread-safe operations
- Duplicate prevention
- Hex-based lookup functionality
- Collection-like interface (`__len__`, `__contains__`, `__iter__`)
- Performance metrics tracking

**Usage:**
```python
identities = IdentityCollection()
identity = Identity(b"identity_bytes_32_chars_long!")
identities.add(identity)
found = identities.find_by_hex(identity.to_hex())
```

#### 3. ConnectionIdCollection
Specialized collection for SpacetimeDB ConnectionId objects:

**Features:**
- Hash-based storage for efficient lookups
- Metadata support for each connection
- Hex string lookup with validation
- Thread-safe operations
- Metadata management (get/set operations)

**Usage:**
```python
connections = ConnectionIdCollection()
conn_id = ConnectionId(b"connection_data")
connections.add(conn_id, {"client": "web", "version": "1.0"})
metadata = connections.get_metadata(conn_id)
```

#### 4. QueryIdCollection
Specialized collection for SpacetimeDB QueryId objects:

**Features:**
- Timestamp tracking for each query
- Age-based query management
- Automatic cleanup of old queries
- Metadata support
- Thread-safe operations

**Usage:**
```python
queries = QueryIdCollection()
query_id = QueryId(1001)
queries.add(query_id, {"sql": "SELECT * FROM users"})
old_queries = queries.find_by_age(60.0)  # Older than 60 seconds
removed_count = queries.cleanup_old_queries(300.0)  # Remove queries older than 5 minutes
```

#### 5. ConcurrentSet
Thread-safe set implementation with set operations:

**Features:**
- Thread-safe add/remove/contains operations
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Atomic operations with proper locking
- Collection-like interface

**Usage:**
```python
concurrent_set = ConcurrentSet()
concurrent_set.add("item1")
concurrent_set.add("item2")
union_result = set1.union(set2)
```

#### 6. LRUCache
Least Recently Used cache with hit ratio tracking:

**Features:**
- Configurable maximum size
- Automatic eviction of least recently used items
- Hit ratio tracking and statistics
- Thread-safe operations
- Dict-like interface

**Usage:**
```python
cache = LRUCache(max_size=1000)
cache.set("key", "value")
value = cache.get("key")
hit_ratio = cache.get_hit_ratio()
```

### Management and Utilities

#### 7. CollectionManager
Centralized management for all data structures:

**Features:**
- Factory methods for creating collections
- Global collection registry
- Metrics aggregation across all collections
- Bulk operations (clear all, get all metrics)
- Named collection management

**Usage:**
```python
manager = CollectionManager()
ops_map = manager.create_operations_map("game_data")
identities = manager.create_identity_collection("players")
all_metrics = manager.get_all_metrics()
```

#### 8. CollectionMetrics
Performance monitoring for all data structures:

**Features:**
- Operation count tracking
- Timing statistics (min, max, average, total)
- Thread-safe metric updates
- Dictionary export for reporting

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Total operation count
- Total execution time
- Average execution time per operation
- Minimum execution time
- Maximum execution time

#### 9. Convenience Functions
Global utility functions for easy collection creation:

```python
# Factory functions
ops_map = create_operations_map("name", equality_func=custom_eq)
identities = create_identity_collection("players")
connections = create_connection_id_collection("active_conns")
queries = create_query_id_collection("pending_queries")
concurrent_set = create_concurrent_set("shared_data")
cache = create_lru_cache("player_cache", max_size=500)

# Global access
collection = get_collection("name")
all_metrics = get_all_metrics()
```

## Integration with Existing SDK

### Export Integration
Updated `src/spacetimedb_sdk/__init__.py` to export all data structures:

```python
# Data structures
from .data_structures import (
    OperationsMap, IdentityCollection, ConnectionIdCollection, QueryIdCollection,
    ConcurrentSet, LRUCache, CollectionManager, CollectionStrategy,
    CollectionMetrics, Equalable, collection_manager,
    create_operations_map, create_identity_collection, create_connection_id_collection,
    create_query_id_collection, create_concurrent_set, create_lru_cache,
    get_collection, get_all_metrics
)
```

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing SDK functionality remains unchanged
- New data structures are additive enhancements
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Optional usage - developers can choose when to use specialized collections

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from spacetimedb_sdk import (
    OperationsMap, IdentityCollection, ConnectionIdCollection,
    create_operations_map, create_identity_collection
)

# Create specialized collections
player_data = create_operations_map("players")
active_identities = create_identity_collection("active_players")

# Use with SpacetimeDB types
identity = Identity(b"player_identity_bytes_32_chars!")
active_identities.add(identity)

player_data.set("player_1", {"score": 1000, "level": 10})
```

### Advanced Usage with Custom Equality
```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, id, name):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name

def player_equality(p1, p2):
    return p1.id == p2.id

# Create map with custom equality
player_map = OperationsMap(equality_func=player_equality)
player1 = Player(1, "Alice")
player2 = Player(1, "Alice Updated")  # Same ID, different name

player_map.set(player1, {"score": 100})
player_map.set(player2, {"score": 200})  # Updates existing entry
assert player_map.size() == 1  # Only one entry due to custom equality
```

### Gaming Server Example
```python
from spacetimedb_sdk import (
    CollectionManager, Identity, ConnectionId, QueryId
)

# Set up game server collections
manager = CollectionManager()
online_players = manager.create_identity_collection("online_players")
active_connections = manager.create_connection_id_collection("connections")
pending_queries = manager.create_query_id_collection("queries")
player_cache = manager.create_lru_cache("player_data", max_size=1000)

# Player joins
player_identity = Identity(b"player_123_identity_bytes_here!")
connection_id = ConnectionId(b"connection_456_bytes_here!")

online_players.add(player_identity)
active_connections.add(connection_id, {
    "client": "web",
    "version": "1.0",
    "region": "us-east"
})

# Cache player data
player_cache.set(f"player_{player_identity.to_hex()}", {
    "name": "Alice",
    "level": 25,
    "guild": "Warriors"
})

# Query management
query_id = QueryId(1001)
pending_queries.add(query_id, {
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE player_id = ?",
    "timeout": 30
})

# Cleanup old queries (older than 5 minutes)
removed_count = pending_queries.cleanup_old_queries(300.0)

# Get performance metrics
all_metrics = manager.get_all_metrics()
for name, metrics in all_metrics.items():
    print(f"{name}: {metrics.operation_count} operations, "
          f"avg time: {metrics.average_time:.6f}s")
```
