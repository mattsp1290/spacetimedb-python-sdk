# Test Hang Fix Summary

## Problem
Two tests were hanging and timing out:
1. `test_connection_identity_success.py` - Hanging in test_connection_metrics 
2. `test_connection_pool.py` - Various tests hanging

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **deadlocks** in the threading code. Python's standard `threading.Lock()` is not reentrant, meaning a thread cannot acquire the same lock it already holds. This caused deadlocks when methods called other methods that also tried to acquire the same lock.

## Specific Issues Found

### 1. ConnectionStateTracker Deadlock
- `get_connection_duration()` acquired the lock and then called `is_connected()`
- `is_connected()` called `get_connection_state()` 
- `get_connection_state()` tried to acquire the same lock → DEADLOCK

### 2. ConnectionMetrics Deadlock  
- `get_connection_stats()` acquired the lock and then called `self.get_average_duration()`
- `get_average_duration()` tried to acquire the same lock → DEADLOCK

### 3. ConnectionLifecycleManager Potential Deadlock
- Similar pattern where methods could call other methods that acquire the same lock

## Solution
Changed all `threading.Lock()` to `threading.RLock()` (reentrant lock) in:
- `ConnectionStateTracker.__init__()`
- `ConnectionLifecycleManager.__init__()`  
- `ConnectionMetrics.__init__()`

## Code Changes

```python
# Before (causes deadlock):
self._lock = threading.Lock()

# After (allows reentrant locking):
self._lock = threading.RLock()  # Use reentrant lock to prevent deadlocks
```

## Additional Fixes

1. **Fixed test assertion logic** in `test_enhanced_identity_token`:
   - The test was expecting `refresh_if_needed(threshold=1)` to return True for a token expiring in 24 hours
   - Fixed to use proper thresholds: 23 hours (no refresh) and 25 hours (needs refresh)

2. **Enabled force exit on timeout**:
   - Uncommented `os._exit(1)` in the timeout handler to ensure tests actually exit on timeout

## Verification

Both previously hanging tests now pass successfully:
- ✅ `test_connection_identity_success.py` - All 11 tests pass
- ✅ `test_connection_pool.py` - All tests pass

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always use RLock for recursive/reentrant scenarios**: When a class has multiple methods that may call each other and all need thread safety, use `threading.RLock()` instead of `threading.Lock()`.

2. **Be careful with nested lock acquisitions**: Even with RLock, be mindful of the locking patterns to avoid performance issues.

3. **Test timeouts are essential**: Having proper timeout handlers helps identify hanging tests quickly in CI/CD environments.

4. **Debug logging helps**: The added debug logging in tests helped identify exactly which test functions were hanging.
