  current_status: |
    The Python SDK has achieved excellent TypeScript parity (95%) and is already
    production-ready for client-side applications. However, to be truly professional-grade
    and match the full SpacetimeDB client ecosystem, we need:
    
    1. CLI Integration (prof-1) - Essential for developer workflow
    2. Code Generation (prof-2) - Critical for type safety and productivity  
    3. Performance Completion (prof-5) - Finishes TypeScript parity
    
    The remaining tasks (prof-3 through prof-9) add enterprise features and
    ecosystem integration that would make the Python SDK best-in-class.
  
  recommended_phases:
    phase_1_critical: "prof-1, prof-2, prof-5 (CLI, Codegen, Performance)"
    phase_2_enterprise: "prof-3, prof-4 (Advanced Connection, Security)"
    phase_3_ecosystem: "prof-6, prof-7, prof-8, prof-9 (Data Types, Frameworks, Ops, Docs)"
  
  professional_grade_criteria: |
    To be considered truly professional-grade, the Python SDK should complete:
    - Phase 1 (Critical): Essential for developer productivity and ecosystem integration
    - Phase 2 (Enterprise): Meets enterprise deployment requirements
    - Phase 3 (Ecosystem): Best-in-class Python ecosystem integration
    
    After Phase 1, the SDK would be on par with Rust/C# for client development.
    After Phases 2-3, it would be the most comprehensive SpacetimeDB client SDK.
