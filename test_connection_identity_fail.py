RED Phase: Failing tests for ConnectionId and Identity Management (proto-6)

These tests define the expected behavior of enhanced ConnectionId tracking,
Identity management, and connection lifecycle management before implementation.
They should all FAIL initially.

Testing:
- Enhanced ConnectionId class with [2]uint64 format support
- Enhanced Identity class with modern format
- Connection state tracking and lifecycle management
- Enhanced IdentityToken processing
- Connection event handling and monitoring
- BSATN serialization for connection types
