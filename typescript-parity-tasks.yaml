    ✅ COMPLETED: Comprehensive specialized data structures implemented
    
    Core Data Structures:
    - OperationsMap: High-performance key-value store with custom equality
    - IdentityCollection: Specialized collection for Identity objects
    - ConnectionIdCollection: Specialized collection for ConnectionId objects  
    - QueryIdCollection: Specialized collection for QueryId objects with age management
    - ConcurrentSet: Thread-safe set implementation with set operations
    - LRUCache: Least Recently Used cache with hit ratio tracking
    - CollectionManager: Centralized management for all data structures
    - CollectionMetrics: Performance monitoring for all operations
    
    Key Features:
    - Thread-safe operations with RLock
    - Performance metrics tracking
    - Dict-like interfaces for familiar Python patterns
    - Custom equality functions for complex key types
    - Metadata support for connections and queries
    - Age-based query management and cleanup
    - Concurrent access patterns
    - Memory-efficient LRU caching
